# Invert Color Shader for Unity
Hello everyone!

I was looking for a simple invert color shader for ages (for free). I fed up with it so I decided to make my own.
I'm giving it for free! You are free to use it in any way you want (commercial or personal)

Though I would appreciate if you credit me in the projects you're working on

**Features:**
- Inverts Color (Any pixel on the screen, UI image or not)
- Mask Texture
- Texture Tint
- Works with existing Unity UI features such as filled or sliced image



Keep developing!
